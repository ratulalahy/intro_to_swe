# Milestone 5.2: Project Presentation and Retrospective

## Overview

Concluding the active development of your To-Do List application, Milestone 5.2 centers on synthesis and reflection. This phase requires delivering a polished presentation of your project, introducing Kanban as an alternative process, and conducting a retrospective to evaluate the semester's efforts. Inspired by capstone presentations in leading engineering programs, you will articulate technical achievements, demonstrate functionality, and derive lessons for future work. This milestone reinforces communication skills and process evaluation, essential for professional software engineers.

By completing this milestone, your team will have showcased your application, compared Agile methods, and documented insights, culminating in a reflective closure.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this milestone, you will be able to:

- Prepare and present a technical project overview, highlighting design, implementation, and outcomes effectively.

- Introduce and contrast Kanban with Scrum, applying it conceptually to your workflow.

- Conduct a structured retrospective to identify strengths, weaknesses, and actionable improvements.

- Finalize project documentation and tools for handover, ensuring completeness.

- Utilize GitHub releases for presentation artifacts, maintaining versioned history.

## Deliverables

Submit the GitHub release link for 5.2 via the course platform. Include materials in the repo, linked in notes. Reference Chapter 2 (Processes: Kanban) for comparisons.

1. **Presentation Slides/Video** (PDF slides in repo/docs; optional 10-15 minute video recording):

   - Structure: Introduction (vision), demo (key features, tests), design highlights (patterns, architecture), challenges/learnings, metrics (e.g., coverage, lines of code).

   - Q&A readiness with anticipated questions.

2. **Kanban Introduction and Comparison** (PDF or Markdown in repo/docs, 1 page):

   - Overview of Kanban (flow, WIP limits); comparison to Scrum used in project.

   - Hypothetical Kanban board sketch for your To-Do List development.

3. **Project Retrospective** (PDF or Markdown in repo/docs, 1-2 pages):

   - Using formats like "What Went Well, What to Improve, Action Items"; include team consensus.

4. **Tool Finalization**:

   - Zenhub: Archived sprints, final backlog status.

   - GitHub: Updated README with full project summary, run/demo instructions.

5. **Individual Reflections** (Submitted separately via form):

   - Responses to: (1) What key lesson from the presentation process will you apply in future projects? (2) How might Kanban have altered your team's workflow?

6. **GitHub Release for 5.2**:

   - Major version (e.g., v5.2) tagged "milestone5.2". Link all materials; notes: "Presentation and retrospective completed." Submit URL.

   **Example GitHub Release Creation**:

   - Repo > Releases > New release.

   - Tag: "milestone5.2".

   - Title: "Milestone 5.2 Presentation".

   - Description: " - Slides: [docs/presentation.pdf] \n - Retrospective: [docs/retrospective.md] \n - Changelog: Added Kanban comparison."

## Tasks and Instructions

Prepare post-5.1; no new code—focus on synthesis.

1. **Presentation Development**:

   - Collaborate on slides; include live demo script.

   - Practice delivery for coherence and time.

2. **Kanban Exploration**:

   - Review Chapter 2; discuss applicability to your project.

3. **Retrospective Session**:

   - Hold a dedicated meeting: Brainstorm openly, prioritize actions.

4. **Documentation Closure**:

   - Polish README as a project portfolio piece.

5. **Release Management**:

   - **End of Week**: Major release with all 5.2 items. Expect: Comprehensive materials, reflective depth.

## Evaluation Rubric

Total: 40 points. Evaluate on communication and introspection.

| Criteria                  | Points | Description |

|---------------------------|--------|-------------|

| **Presentation**         | 20     | Compelling delivery; thorough coverage of project elements. |

| **Kanban & Comparison**  | 5      | Accurate intro; thoughtful Scrum contrast. |

| **Retrospective**        | 5      | Balanced insights; feasible action items. |

| **Tool Finalization & Release**| 5     | Complete updates; professional release. |

| **Individual Reflections**| 5      | Relevant and forward-looking responses. |

Daily late penalty: 10%. Weak presentations require re-delivery.

## Resources and Best Practices

- **Textbook**: Chapter 2 (Kanban); use for comparisons.

- **Tools**: PowerPoint/Google Slides; recording software.

- **Tips**:

  - Engage Audience: Use visuals, demos; anticipate questions.

  - Retrospective: Be honest yet constructive.

  - Avoid Pitfalls: Backup demo; time slides.

- **Support**: Presentation coaching; Kanban examples.

Celebrate your progress— this milestone highlights your growth as engineers.
