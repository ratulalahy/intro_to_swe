# Milestone 5.2: Project Presentation

---

## Overview

> In this final milestone, your group will deliver a **10-minute in-person presentation** to showcase your To-Do List project, covering all aspects from planning to testing. This is your chance to present your work to the instructor and peers in class, like a client meeting with executives. You’ll highlight features, software engineering practices, **testing**, **robustness (try-catch)**, and **code smell removal**. Presentations will occur during class time on July 29–August 1, 2025, with peers encouraged to attend for extra credit.

By completing this milestone, you’ll demonstrate your project’s quality and your team’s engineering skills.

## Deliverables

> **Submit** a `GitHub` release link for the final submission via the course platform. Commit slides and materials to the repository (e.g., in `docs`), linking them in release notes. Include a comment on **code smells** removed (e.g., “Removed long methods and duplicated code”).

### 1. **Presentation Slides**
**Format:** *PDF or PowerPoint* in `docs`  

- Clean, numbered slides covering:
  - Project overview: Purpose and key features.
  - Development: Planning, requirements, UML diagrams, wireframes.
  - Engineering: Design principles, patterns, **testing**, **robustness (try-catch)**, **code smell removal**.
  - Live demo: Show working features (e.g., task creation, prioritization).
  - Future ideas: Possible enhancements (e.g., mobile app).

### 2. **In-Person Presentation**
**Format:** 10-minute presentation in class + 5–10-minute Q&A  

- All team members must speak and answer questions.
- Show your `Zenhub` board to explain team contributions.

### 3. **Tool Updates**
- **`Zenhub`:** Mark tasks complete; update backlog.
- **`GitHub`:** Commit slides; update `README` with presentation details.

### 4. **Individual Reflections**
**Format:** Submitted via form  

- Answer: (1) How did presenting highlight your project’s strengths? (2) What engineering aspect (e.g., testing, code smells) are you proud of?

### 5. **GitHub Release**

#### Final Submission (End of Week)
Major version (e.g., `v5.2`) tagged `"milestone5.2"`. Link slides and materials in release notes, with a changelog and comment on **code smells** removed (e.g., “Removed long methods and duplicated code”). **Submit** URL.

**Example GitHub Release:**  
```markdown
- Repo > Releases > New release.
- Tag: "milestone5.2".
- Title: "Milestone 5.2 Final".
- Description: "- Slides: [docs/slides.pdf] \n- Changelog: Added presentation materials. \n- Code Smells Removed: Long methods, duplicated code."
```

  - **Overview**: Purpose and features.
  - **Process**: Planning, requirements, UML, wireframes, development, **testing**.
  - **Engineering**: Principles, patterns, **robustness**, **code smell removal**.
  - **Demo**: Show the app working.
  - **Future**: Ideas for improvement.
- **Zenhub**: Display board to show contributions.
- **Team**: All members speak equally and handle Q&A.
- **Tips**:
  - Rehearse for smooth delivery.
  - Test the demo for **robustness (try-catch)**.
