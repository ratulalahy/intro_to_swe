# Milestone 5.2: Project Presentation (Online)

---

## Overview

> In this final milestone, your group will deliver a **10-minute online presentation** to showcase your {span .text-gradient-todo}`**To-Do List**` project, covering all aspects from planning to testing. This is your chance to present your work to the instructor and peers, like a client meeting with executives. You’ll highlight features, software engineering practices, **testing**, **robustness (try-catch)**, and **code smell removal**. Presentations will be held via `MS Teams` from July 29–August 1, 2025, with peers encouraged to attend for extra credit.

By completing this milestone, you’ll demonstrate your project’s quality and your team’s engineering skills.

## Scheduling

- **Select a Time**: Choose a 30-minute slot (10-minute presentation + 5–10-minute Q&A) between **July 29–August 1, 2025**.
- **How to Schedule**: Email your top three preferred slots (e.g., “July 29 at 2:00 PM MT”) by **July 29, 2025**. Slots are first-come, first-served.
- **Platform**: Use `MS Teams`. The meeting link will be shared after confirmation.
- **Peer Attendance**: Presentation times and links will be shared with all groups for extra credit attendance.

## Deliverables

> **Submit** a `GitHub` release link for the final submission via the course platform. Commit slides and materials to the repository (e.g., in `docs`), linking them in release notes. Include a comment on **code smells** removed (e.g., “Removed long methods and duplicated code”).

### 1. **Presentation Slides**
**Format:** *PDF or PowerPoint* in `docs`  

- Clean, numbered slides covering:
  - Project overview: Purpose and key features.
  - Development: Planning, requirements, UML diagrams, wireframes.
  - Engineering: Design principles, patterns, **testing**, **robustness (try-catch)**, **code smell removal**.
  - Live demo: Show working features (e.g., task creation, prioritization).
  - Future ideas: Possible enhancements (e.g., mobile app).

### 2. **Live Presentation**
**Format:** 10-minute presentation via `MS Teams` + 5–10-minute Q&A  

- All team members must speak and answer questions.
- Show your `Zenhub` board to explain team contributions.

### 3. **Tool Updates**
- **`Zenhub`:** Mark tasks complete; update backlog.
- **`GitHub`:** Commit slides; update `README` with presentation details.

### 4. **Individual Reflections**
**Format:** Submitted via form  

- Answer: (1) How did presenting highlight your project’s strengths? (2) What engineering aspect (e.g., testing, code smells) are you proud of?

### 5. **GitHub Release**

#### Final Submission (End of Week)
Major version (e.g., `v5.2`) tagged `"milestone5.2"`. Link slides and materials in release notes, with a changelog and comment on **code smells** removed (e.g., “Removed long methods and duplicated code”). **Submit** URL.

**Example GitHub Release:**  
```markdown
- Repo > Releases > New release.
- Tag: "milestone5.2".
- Title: "Milestone 5.2 Final".
- Description: "- Slides: [docs/slides.pdf] \n- Changelog: Added presentation materials. \n- Code Smells Removed: Long methods, duplicated code."
```
