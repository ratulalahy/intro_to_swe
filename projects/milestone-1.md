# Milestone 1: Project Initiation and Setup

## Overview

Welcome to Milestone 1 of your Introduction to Software Engineering course project. This foundational phase launches your semester-long development of a Python-based To-Do List application, employing Agile methodologies and industry-standard tools. As emerging software engineers, you will assemble collaborative teams, articulate a project vision, perform initial planning, and configure essential infrastructure for version control and task management. This milestone underscores the principles of structured collaboration, strategic planning, and tool proficiency, mirroring professional software development environments at top-tier institutions and companies.

By the end of this milestone, your team will have established a cohesive structure, a preliminary product backlog, a draft project plan, and operational tools, ensuring a strong foundation for iterative refinement and high-quality outcomes. All progress and final submissions will be tracked via GitHub releases, promoting version control best practices.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this milestone, you will be able to:

- Form and organize a high-functioning team with defined roles and communication protocols, promoting equity and accountability.
- Develop a clear project vision and initial backlog for your To-Do List application, aligning with user needs and Agile practices.
- Conduct preliminary planning to outline core features, timelines, and risks, fostering proactive decision-making.
- Configure and integrate tools like Git/GitHub for version control and Zenhub for task management, enabling efficient workflow tracking.
- Apply foundational Agile concepts to initiate sprint planning, emphasizing adaptability and continuous improvement.
- Utilize GitHub releases for versioning deliverables, simulating professional deployment workflows.

## Deliverables

Submit links to your GitHub releases (for progress check and final milestone) via the course platform (e.g., Canvas submission form). Include all supporting documents within the repository and reference them in the release notes. Ensure documents are professionally formatted, with consistent headings, fonts, and references to the course textbook where applicable.

### 1. Team Formation Document
**Format:** PDF or Markdown in repo, 1-2 pages
- Roster of team members (3-5 students) with initial roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developers, Tester) and a rotation schedule for the Scrum Master role.
- Communication plan, including weekly meeting schedule (at least one synchronous session) and preferred channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).

### 2. Project Vision and Planning Draft
**Format:** PDF or Markdown in repo, 1 page
- Vision statement for the To-Do List application, detailing purpose, target users (e.g., students, professionals), key problems solved (e.g., task overload), and unique value proposition (e.g., customizable categories or deadline reminders—tailor to your team's innovative ideas).
- High-level project plan, including preliminary timeline (e.g., milestones mapped to weeks), potential risks (e.g., integration challenges), and mitigation strategies.

### 3. Initial Product Backlog
**Format:** PDF or Markdown export from Zenhub in repo, 1-2 pages
- 10+ user stories (12+ for teams of 5), prioritized and formatted as: "As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]." Focus on core To-Do List functionalities (e.g., task addition, prioritization, status updates).
- 2-3 non-functional requirements (e.g., "The application shall support cross-platform usage with minimal dependencies.").

### 4. Tool Setup Documentation
**Format:** In repo README.md or separate file
- GitHub repository details, including branching strategy (e.g., main for stable code, feature branches for development).
- Zenhub board export or screenshot, showing the product backlog, epics (e.g., "User Authentication"), and initial tasks linked to GitHub issues.

### 5. First Meeting Minutes
**Format:** PDF or Markdown in repo, 1 page
- Attendance, agenda, key decisions (e.g., vision consensus, task assignments), and action items with owners and deadlines.

### 6. Individual Reflections
**Format:** Submitted separately via online form
- Responses to: (1) How does this project's vision align with your career goals in software engineering? (2) What challenge do you anticipate in team collaboration, and how will you address it?

### 7. GitHub Releases

#### Progress Check (Mid-Week)
Create a minor version release (e.g., v0.1) tagged as "milestone1-progress". Include partial deliverables (e.g., draft team document, initial backlog items in Zenhub). Release notes should summarize progress (e.g., "Initial team setup and backlog draft completed"). Submit the release URL.

#### Final Milestone Submission (End of Week)
Create a major version release (e.g., v1.0) tagged as "milestone1". Attach or link all deliverables in the release notes, with a changelog highlighting completions and any updates from the progress check. Submit the release URL.

**Example GitHub Release Creation:**
- Navigate to your repo > Releases > Draft a new release.
- Tag: "milestone1" (for final) or "milestone1-progress-v0.1" (for check).
- Title: "Milestone 1 Submission" or "Milestone 1 Progress Check".
- Description: Bullet points on deliverables, e.g.:
  - Team Formation Document: [link to file in repo]
  - Product Backlog: [Zenhub URL]
- Attach binaries if needed (e.g., PDFs), or use repo links.

## Tasks and Instructions

Proceed methodically through these steps, leveraging collaborative tools for real-time input. Reference the textbook (e.g., Chapter 2 on Processes) for Agile guidance. All work should be committed to GitHub progressively.

### 1. Team Formation and Role Definition
- Confirm team via Canvas; address any issues with the instructor promptly.
- Assign roles based on individual strengths, ensuring rotation for Scrum Master to build leadership skills across the team.
- Establish norms for communication and conflict resolution to promote a positive, inclusive environment.

### 2. Vision and Planning Development
- Brainstorm during your first meeting: Define the To-Do List's scope, users, and differentiators (e.g., mobile responsiveness or integration with external APIs—plan your unique features).
- Draft the vision and plan, incorporating feedback to ensure buy-in from all members.

### 3. Product Backlog Creation
- Elicit requirements collaboratively, drawing from Chapter 3 (Requirements) for user stories and non-functional specs.
- Prioritize items using simple estimation techniques like planning poker.

### 4. Tool Configuration
- Initialize GitHub: Add collaborators, create branches, and commit an initial structure (e.g., folders for src, docs).
- Set up Zenhub: Link to GitHub, create issues from user stories, and configure workflows (e.g., columns for Backlog, In Progress, Done).

### 5. Sprint Planning Initiation
- Outline tasks for the next milestone, estimate effort, and assign based on roles.
- Schedule standups to maintain momentum.

### 6. Meeting Execution
- Conduct a structured session: Start with agenda review, end with action items.
- Document comprehensively to demonstrate process adherence.

### 7. Progress Check and Release Management

#### By Mid-Week (Progress Check)
Complete at least 50% of deliverables (e.g., team doc, draft backlog). Create and submit a minor GitHub release (e.g., v0.1) with notes on status. Expect: Initial commits visible, Zenhub partially populated, drafts shared for feedback.

#### By End of Week (Final Submission)
Finalize all items, commit changes, and create the major release (e.g., v1.0). Expect: Complete repo with all files, fully set up Zenhub, polished documents. Submit the release URL; no separate ZIP needed—instructor will review via links.

### Tool Guides
- GitHub's release documentation; Zenhub quick-start. Textbook Appendix on Git for reference.

### Tips for Excellence
- **Customize Your To-Do List:** While core is standard, plan unique features (e.g., priority algorithms) to showcase creativity.
- **Release Best Practices:** Use semantic versioning (e.g., major for milestones, minor for checks); include changelogs.
- **Collaboration:** Commit frequently with meaningful messages; use pull requests for reviews.
- **Avoid Pitfalls:** Ensure releases are tagged correctly; test links before submission.

### Support
- Office hours for tool setup; peer discussions for planning ideas.
