# Milestone 1: Project Initiation and Setup

## Overview

Milestone 1 kicks off your *Introduction to Software Engineering* project, developing a To-Do List application using Agile methodologies. This phase establishes your team, project vision, initial backlog, and tools (GitHub, Zenhub). Submit GitHub release links (e.g., `https://github.com/user_name/project_name/releases/tag/v0.1`) via Canvas, with a 20% penalty for missing the mid-week progress check. All repository documents must be professionally formatted Markdown with consistent headings, fonts, and textbook references.

## Learning Objectives

- Form a team with defined roles and a communication plan (in-person meetings, Microsoft Teams for async updates).
- Define a project vision and backlog aligned with user needs.
- Create a project plan with timelines and risk mitigation.
- Configure GitHub for version control and Zenhub for task management.
- Apply Agile principles for sprint planning.
- Use GitHub releases for professional versioning.

## Tasks and Instructions

1. **Tool Configuration**
   - Initialize GitHub: Add collaborators, create `main` and feature branches, set up `/task_manager_app/src` and `/task_manager_app/docs`.
   - Configure Zenhub: Link to GitHub, create issues from user stories, set up workflows (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Done).
   - Document in `/task_manager_app/docs/tool_setup.md`.

2. **First Meeting Execution**
   - Conduct an in-person meeting with a clear agenda (e.g., role assignments, vision discussion).
   - Assign action items with owners and deadlines.
   - Document in `/task_manager_app/docs/meeting_minutes/sprint_1/week_1.md`.

3. **Team Formation**
   - Assign roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developers, Tester, Meeting Recorder, with Scrum Master rotation.
   - Define communication: Weekly in-person meeting, Microsoft Teams for async updates.
   - Document in `/task_manager_app/docs/team_formation.md`.

4. **Project Vision and Planning**
   - Brainstorm To-Do List scope, users (e.g., students), and unique features (e.g., task categorization) in the first meeting.
   - Draft vision statement and project plan (timeline, risks, mitigation).
   - Commit to `/task_manager_app/docs/vision_plan.md` after team feedback.

5. **Product Backlog Creation**
   - Each member submits 5+ functional and 2+ non-functional requirements in `/task_manager_app/docs/requirements` (e.g., `/task_manager_app/docs/requirements/member_1.md`).
   - Scrum Master consolidates into `/task_manager_app/docs/backlog.md` with 10+ prioritized user stories (12+ for teams of 5), formatted as: "As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]." Include 2-3 non-functional requirements.
   - Export to Zenhub for prioritization.

6. **Individual Reflections**
   - Submit a `.md` file via Canvas (not GitHub) with GitHub release link, Zenhub board link, and reflection answers (see Submission Checklist).

7. **GitHub Releases**
   - **Progress Check (Mid-Week):** Create a minor release (`v0.1`, tagged `milestone1-progress-v0.1`) with draft deliverables. Submit URL via Canvas. **Note**: Missing this incurs a 20% penalty.
   - **Final Submission (End of Week):** Create a major release (`v1.0`, tagged `milestone1`) with all deliverables linked in release notes and a changelog. Submit URL via Canvas.

## Submission Checklist

Submit via Canvas:
- GitHub release links for progress check and final submission.
- A `.md` file (`reflection.md`) containing:
  - GitHub release link (e.g., `https://github.com/user_name/project_name/releases/tag/v1.0`).
  - Zenhub board link (e.g., `https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/...`).
  - Reflection answers:
    - **Contribution to the project** (50-100 words): Describe your specific contributions (e.g., user stories, tool setup).
    - **Rating team dynamics** (1-5 scale, with justification, 50 words): Rate collaboration and communication; explain your rating.
    - **How does the project vision align with your software engineering goals?** (50-100 words): Connect the project to your career aspirations.
    - **Feedback/comment about this milestone** (50 words): Suggest one improvement for the process or team dynamics.
