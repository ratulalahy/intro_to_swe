description: Team-based software development projects applying course concepts
---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

Projects provide hands-on experience with software development in team environments. You'll apply course concepts to build real-world applications while practicing collaboration, project management, and professional development workflows.

The semester-long To-Do List application project is divided into structured milestones that align with course modules and build progressively toward a complete software solution.

```{note}
**Project Guidelines**
- Teams of 3-5 students
- Agile development methodology
- Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives
- Professional-quality deliverables
- GitHub releases for milestone submissions
```
