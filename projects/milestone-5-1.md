# Milestone 5.1: Testing

---

## Overview

> As the penultimate development phase of your To-Do List application, **Milestone 5.1** prioritizes quality assurance through **_testing_**, **_robustness (try-catch/exception)_**, **_test coverage reporting_**, and **_code smell removal_**. This week-long milestone involves creating extensive test suites with coverage analysis and refactoring code to eliminate smells, enhancing reliability and maintainability. Aligned with textbook guidance on testing and refactoring, you will prepare your project for presentation and final deployment, reflecting rigorous engineering standards in advanced academic curricula where validation is key to professional-grade software.

By completing this milestone, your team will deliver a thoroughly tested, optimized codebase with robust error handling and documented code smell removal, ensuring a high-quality application.

---

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this milestone, you will be able to:

- **Construct and execute** a comprehensive test suite encompassing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, while evaluating coverage to identify gaps.
- **Detect and resolve** code smells through systematic refactoring, preserving functionality while enhancing code quality.
- **Incorporate robust error handling** using try-catch/exception mechanisms to improve application stability.
- **Update project artifacts** and tools to reflect quality improvements, facilitating traceability and collaboration.
- **Incorporate iterative feedback** via releases, reinforcing Agile refinement.

---

## Deliverables

> **Submit** the `GitHub` release link for the final 5.1 submission via the course platform. Commit all code, tests, and docs to the repository, linking them in release notes. Reference Chapters 8 (*Testing*) and 9 (*Refactoring*) for techniques and examples. Focus on **_testing_**, **_robustness (try-catch/exception)_**, **_test coverage reporting_**, and **_code smell removal_**.

### 1. **_Test Suite and Coverage Report_**
**Format:** In `repo/tests`; *PDF report* in `repo/docs`  

- 20+ tests for features/patterns (unit for components, integration for interactions, E2E for flows), including **_try-catch/exception_** handling for robustness.
- Coverage analysis (e.g., `pytest-cov` report, targeting 80%+; include metrics and visualizations).

### 2. **_Refactoring Documentation_**
**Format:** *PDF or Markdown* in `repo/docs`, 1-2 pages  

- Identification and removal of 5+ **_code smells_** (e.g., long methods, duplication) with before/after code examples.
- Refactored segments in `repo/src`, with explanations of applied techniques (e.g., extract class).

### 3. **_Tool Updates_**

- **`Zenhub`:** Tasks marked complete; backlog refined for final phase.
- **`GitHub`:** Commits for refactors/tests; updated `README` with test execution guide.

### 4. **_Individual Reflections_**
**Format:** Submitted separately via form  

- Responses to: (1) How did achieving test coverage influence your code's reliability? (2) What refactoring technique proved most impactful, and why?

### 5. **_GitHub Release_**

#### Final 5.1 Submission (End of Week)
Major version (e.g., `v5.1`) tagged `"milestone5.1"`. Link all deliverables in release notes, with a changelog detailing improvements. Include a comment specifying which **_code smells_** were found and removed (e.g., "Found and removed long methods and duplicated code"). **Submit** URL.

**Example GitHub Release Creation:**  
```markdown
- Repo > Releases > New release.
- Tag: "milestone5.1" (final).
- Title: "Milestone 5.1 Final".
- Description: " - Coverage Report: [docs/coverage.pdf] \n - Refactoring Log: [docs/refactor.md] \n - Changelog: Added E2E tests and fixed smells. \n - Code Smells Removed: Long methods, duplicated code."
```

---

## Tasks and Instructions

Extend Milestone 4; use branches like `"refactor/smell-resolution"`.

### 1. **Test Suite Creation**
- Expand prior tests; follow TDD for refactors per Chapter 8 (*Testing*).
- Include **_try-catch/exception_** handling in tests to ensure robustness.
- Run coverage tools (e.g., `pytest-cov`); address low-coverage areas.

### 2. **Code Refactoring**
- Audit for **_code smells_** using Chapter 9 (*Refactoring*); refactor iteratively (e.g., inline temp variables).
- Document specific smells found and removed (e.g., long methods, duplication).
- Verify with tests to ensure no regressions.

### 3. **Artifact Updates**
- Sync `Zenhub`/`GitHub`; document changes in `README` with test execution guide.

### 4. **Release Management**

#### End of Week
Full validation with tests, refactored code, and coverage report. Create major release (`v5.1`). *Expect*: Passing tests, optimized code with removed **_code smells_**, high **_test coverage_**.

## Evaluation Rubric

Total: **40 points**. Assess on thoroughness, robustness, and code smell removal.

| **Criteria**              | **Points** | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Suite & Coverage**| 16         | Extensive tests with **_try-catch/exception_**; high coverage with analysis.     |
| **Refactoring**           | 12         | Effective **_code smell_** removal; documented improvements.                     |
| **Tool Updates & Releases**| 7         | Complete updates; detailed versioning with **_code smell_** comments.            |
| **Individual Reflections**| 3          | Insightful ties to quality practices.                                            |

> **Note:** Daily late penalty: 10%. Failing tests require fixes.

## Resources and Best Practices

### Textbook Integration
- Chapter 8 (*Testing: Coverage, TDD*); Chapter 9 (*Refactoring: Smells, Techniques*).

### Tools
- [`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for test coverage analysis.
- [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for alternative coverage reporting.
- [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for built-in Python testing framework.
- [`nose2`](https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/) for extended testing capabilities.

### Tips for Excellence
- **Coverage:** Focus on branches/conditions; include **_exception_** cases.
- **Refactor:** Document specific **_code smells_** removed; use small steps and test.
- **Release:** Clearly comment on removed **_code smells_** in release notes.
- **Avoid Pitfalls:** Ensure cross-platform compatibility; verify tests pass.

### Support
- Debugging sessions; refactoring examples.
