# Milestone 4: Feature Implementation with Design Principles and Patterns

## Overview
Progressing from the architectural foundation in Milestone 3, Milestone 4 emphasizes the application of design principles and patterns to expand your To-Do List application's functionality. This phase involves selecting and implementing 3-7 features from your product backlog, integrating SOLID principles for code quality, and applying relevant design patterns to solve common problems elegantly. With a focus on maintainable, scalable code and comprehensive testing, you will evolve your MVP into a more feature-rich prototype. This milestone draws on professional software design practices taught in elite engineering programs, ensuring your project embodies reusability, flexibility, and robustness.

By the end of this milestone, your team will have an enhanced application with principled design, patterned solutions, and thorough tests, ready for advanced quality assurance and deployment considerations.

## Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this milestone, you will be able to:
- Select and prioritize features from the backlog, implementing them in Python while adhering to Agile iteration principles.
- Apply SOLID design principles to refactor and structure code, minimizing dependencies and maximizing cohesion.
- Incorporate 3-5 design patterns (e.g., Factory, Observer) to address recurring design challenges in your To-Do List application.
- Develop and execute test cases for new features, ensuring functionality and edge-case coverage.
- Manage project evolution through updated tools and GitHub releases, facilitating peer review and versioned progress tracking.

## Deliverables
Submit GitHub release links for progress check and final submission via the course platform. Commit code, tests, and docs to the repository, linking them in release notes. Reference textbook Chapters 5 (Design Principles) and 6 (Design Patterns) for justification and examples.

1. **Feature Implementation Report** (PDF or Markdown in repo/docs, 2-3 pages):
   - Description of 3-7 selected backlog features (e.g., task categorization, search functionality, due date reminders).
   - Rationale for prioritization and how each aligns with the project vision.

2. **Design Principles Application** (Annotated code/comments in repo/src):
   - Evidence of SOLID principles (e.g., Single Responsibility in task classes, Open-Closed for extensibility).
   - Before/after code snippets showing refactorings.

3. **Design Patterns Integration** (PDF or Markdown in repo/docs, 1-2 pages + code):
   - 3-5 patterns applied (e.g., Observer for notifications, Strategy for sorting algorithms).
   - Diagrams or explanations of each pattern's use, with code excerpts demonstrating implementation.

4. **Updated Codebase and Tests** (In repo/src and /tests):
   - Python code for new features, building on MVC from prior milestones.
   - 10+ test cases (unit/integration) covering features and patterns (e.g., test_observer_notification()).

5. **Tool Updates**:
   - Zenhub: Backlog refinements, completed tasks moved, new issues for patterns/features.
   - GitHub: Feature branches merged; README updated with new usage instructions.

6. **Team Meeting Minutes** (PDF or Markdown in repo, 1 page):
   - Coverage of feature selection, pattern discussions, and task assignments.

7. **Individual Reflections** (Submitted separately via form):
   - Responses to: (1) How did applying design patterns improve your To-Do List's code? (2) Which SOLID principle was most challenging to implement, and why?

8. **GitHub Releases**:
   - **Progress Check (Mid-Week)**: Minor version (e.g., v3.1) tagged "milestone4-progress". Include partial implementations (e.g., 2 features coded, initial patterns). Notes: Outline advancements (e.g., "Implemented search feature with Strategy pattern draft"). Submit URL.
   - **Final Milestone Submission (End of Week)**: Major version (e.g., v4.0) tagged "milestone4". Link all deliverables; changelog from check (e.g., "Completed 5 features; refined Observer pattern based on tests"). Submit URL.

   **Example GitHub Release Creation**:
   - Repo > Releases > New release.
   - Tag: "milestone4" (final) or "milestone4-progress-v3.1" (check).
   - Title: "Milestone 4 Final" or "Milestone 4 Progress".
   - Description: " - Features Report: [docs/features.pdf] \n - Patterns Code: [src/observer.py] \n - Changelog: Added tests for all new features."

## Tasks and Instructions
Extend Milestone 3 work; use branches like "feature/task-search" for isolation.

1. **Feature Selection and Prioritization**:
   - Review backlog in Zenhub; choose 3-7 items based on value and feasibility.
   - Map to vision: Ensure features enhance core To-Do List utility.

2. **Applying Design Principles**:
   - Audit code for SOLID violations; refactor (e.g., Interface Segregation for flexible APIs).
   - Document changes per Chapter 5 guidelines.

3. **Integrating Design Patterns**:
   - Select patterns fitting features (e.g., Singleton for config, Factory for task types).
   - Implement and diagram per Chapter 6; justify choices.

4. **Code and Test Development**:
   - Code features in Python; maintain MVC.
   - Write tests first (TDD-inspired); cover nominal and edge cases.

5. **Tool and Documentation Sync**:
   - Link Zenhub issues to pattern/feature commits.
   - Update README with build/test commands.

6. **Meetings and Iteration**:
   - Discuss implementations; plan Milestone 5.

7. **Progress Check and Release Management**:
   - **Mid-Week**: 50% features/patterns done. Minor release for review. Expect: Partial code commits, draft docs/tests.
   - **End of Week**: Full integration, tested. Major release. Expect: Runnable app with new features, complete patterns, high test coverage.

## Evaluation Rubric
Total: 100 points. Evaluate on design elegance, code quality, and integration.

| Criteria                  | Points | Description |
|---------------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Feature Implementation**| 25     | Selected features well-integrated; functional and user-aligned. |
| **Design Principles**    | 20     | Effective SOLID application; improved code quality demonstrated. |
| **Design Patterns**      | 25     | Appropriate patterns implemented; clear explanations and usage. |
| **Tests & Codebase**     | 15     | Comprehensive tests; clean, modular code. |
| **Tool Updates & Releases**| 10    | Updated artifacts; detailed releases. |
| **Meeting Minutes**      | 5      | Collaborative insights documented. |
| **Individual Reflections**| 5      | Thoughtful analysis of design impacts. |

Daily late penalty: 10%. Failing tests require fixes.

## Resources and Best Practices
- **Textbook**: Chapter 5 (Principles: SOLID) for refactoring; Chapter 6 (Patterns: Factory, etc.) for examples.
- **Tools**: pylint for code quality; pytest for advanced testing.
- **Tips**:
  - Balance: Choose patterns that fit naturally; avoid over-engineering.
  - Testing: Aim for 80% coverage; include pattern-specific tests.
  - Innovation: Enhance To-Do List with patterns (e.g., Decorator for task decorators).
  - Avoid Pitfalls: Document pattern rationale; ensure releases are self-contained.
- **Support**: Code review sessions; textbook exercises for patterns.

This milestone elevates your designâ€”principled implementation ensures a resilient application.
