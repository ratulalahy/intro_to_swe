### üé¨ The Birth of Software Engineering

*A fascinating look at how software engineering emerged as a discipline*

## ‚ö° The Four Essential Challenges of Software

Frederick Brooks, Turing Award winner and software engineering pioneer, identified why software is uniquely challenging:

::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item-card} üß© **Complexity**
Software systems are among the most complex human creations. A modern smartphone app can have millions of interconnected parts.

**Example:** WhatsApp handles 100+ billion messages daily across 2+ billion users with just ~1,000 employees.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} üîÑ **Changeability**  
Software must constantly evolve. Success brings more feature requests, not stability.

**Example:** Facebook started as a college directory and evolved into a global social platform serving billions.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} üéØ **Conformity**
Software must adapt to changing environments, laws, and business needs.

**Example:** GDPR regulations forced thousands of apps to redesign their privacy features overnight.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} üëª **Invisibility**
Unlike bridges or cars, you can't easily "see" software structure, making it hard to understand and debug.

**Example:** A single misplaced character crashed a $370 million rocket (Ariane 5, 1996).
:::

::::

```{admonition} Why No "Silver Bullet"? ü•à
:class: warning

Brooks argued there's no single technology that will solve all software problems. Why? Because the **essential complexity** of software comes from the problems we're solving, not just the tools we use.

Think about it: Building a social network, a medical device, and a video game all require fundamentally different approaches.
```

## üó∫Ô∏è The Software Engineering Landscape

Software engineering encompasses many interconnected areas:

      Quality
```

### üîç Let's Explore Each Area

::::{dropdown} **üìã Requirements Engineering**

**What it is:** Understanding and documenting what the software should do.

**Why it matters:** Building the wrong thing perfectly is worse than building the right thing imperfectly.

**Real example:** The FBI's Virtual Case File project was cancelled after $170M because requirements kept changing.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to gather requirements from stakeholders
- Writing user stories and use cases  
- Managing changing requirements
- Balancing competing needs
::::

::::{dropdown} **üèóÔ∏è Software Design & Architecture**

**What it is:** Planning the structure and organization of your software.

**Why it matters:** Good architecture makes software maintainable, scalable, and extensible.

**Real example:** Netflix's microservices architecture allows them to deploy 1000+ times per day.

**What you'll learn:**
- Design patterns and principles
- System architecture styles
- API design
- Database design
::::

::::{dropdown} **‚ö° Implementation & Programming**

**What it is:** Writing the actual code that makes your software work.

**Why it matters:** Even great designs fail with poor implementation.

**Real example:** Clean, readable code at Google allows any engineer to understand and modify most codebases.

**What you'll learn:**
- Best coding practices
- Code organization
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
::::

::::{dropdown} **üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance**

**What it is:** Ensuring your software works correctly and reliably.

**Why it matters:** Bugs in production can cost millions and damage reputation.

**Real example:** A single software bug in Knight Capital's trading system lost $440M in 45 minutes.

**What you'll learn:**
- Automated testing strategies
- Test-driven development
- Quality metrics
- Bug prevention techniques
::::

## üéØ Types of Software Systems

Not all software is created equal. Different types require different approaches:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} üöÄ **Mission-Critical Systems**
:sync: critical

**Examples:** Medical devices, aircraft control, nuclear power

**Characteristics:**

## üí∞ The Economics of Software

Understanding the business side is crucial for any software engineer:

::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item-card} üìà **Software Business Models**
- **SaaS:** Subscription-based (Netflix, Spotify)
- **Freemium:** Free basic, paid premium (Zoom)
- **Marketplace:** Platform commission (App Store)
- **Advertising:** Free for users, advertisers pay (Google)
- **Enterprise:** Big contracts (Salesforce)
:::

:::{grid-item-card} üí∏ **Cost Breakdown**
```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Phase
  - % of Total Cost
* - Development
  - 20%
* - Maintenance
  - 60%
* - Enhancement
  - 20%
```
:::

::::

```{admonition} The 80/20 Rule üìä
:class: important

**80% of a software's total cost** comes AFTER the initial release! This is why writing maintainable, evolvable code is crucial - you'll be living with it for years.
```

## üöÄ Your First Challenge

Let's start with a fun exercise to get you thinking like a software engineer:

```{exercise} Software Engineering Mindset
:label: mindset-exercise

**Scenario:** You're tasked with building a food delivery app like DoorDash or Uber Eats.

**Your Challenge:** Without writing any code, think through these questions:

1. **Users:** Who are the different types of users? (Hint: It's not just customers!)

2. **Core Features:** What are the 5 most essential features your app needs to work?

3. **Technical Challenges:** What are 3 difficult technical problems you'd need to solve?

4. **Quality Requirements:** How would you ensure the app is fast, reliable, and secure?

5. **Success Metrics:** How would you measure if your app is successful?

**Deliverable:** Write a 1-page summary addressing these questions. This isn't about having the "right" answers - it's about thinking systematically about software problems.

**Due:** Next class session
```
