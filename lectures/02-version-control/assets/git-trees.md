# Git Trees Diagram

This would contain a visual representation of Git's three main areas:

1. **Working Directory** - Your current project files
2. **Staging Area** - Files prepared for commit  
3. **Repository** - Committed project history

*Image placeholder - actual diagram would show the flow between these three areas*
